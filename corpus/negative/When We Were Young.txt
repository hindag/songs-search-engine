Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
Because you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before you realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before you realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
I was so mad I made home, it makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young
